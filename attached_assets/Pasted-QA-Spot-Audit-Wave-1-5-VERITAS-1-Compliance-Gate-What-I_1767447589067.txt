QA Spot Audit (Wave 1–5) — VERITAS-1 Λ Compliance Gate

What I audited (spot check method)
	•	Random + high-impact sampling across all waves
	•	Checked against the locked 8-section structure + verbatim disclaimer requirement + no-hallucination / no-assumptions rules

⸻

Critical Findings (Must Fix)

1) Disclaimer is NOT compliant in most Wave 1–5 assets
	•	Many assets end with “Standard disclaimer applied.” instead of the required verbatim disclaimer text.
	•	This fails the hard gate: “Disclaimer (Must Be Verbatim).”

Fix: Replace every “Standard disclaimer applied” line with the exact disclaimer block (see Patch below).

⸻

2) Several assets are under-specified in Sections 4–6
A number of assets (especially Wave 1–2) have:
	•	Section 4 steps that are too high-level (not stress-usable, not independently actionable)
	•	Sections 5–6 that are too short to be “elite-tier operational” (still compliant, but not premium)

Fix: These need expanded, concrete steps (without adding law/facts), plus fuller failure modes and recordkeeping guidance.

Spot Audit Results by Wave (Pass/Fail with reasons)

Wave 1 (Assets 1–10)
	•	FAIL (library-wide) due to non-verbatim disclaimer usage in multiple assets.
	•	Needs enhancement: Assets 2, 6, 8 are overly skeletal.

Wave 2 (Assets 11–20)
	•	FAIL (library-wide) due to non-verbatim disclaimer.
	•	Needs enhancement: 13, 14, 18, 19 are too abstract for “downloadable asset” standard.

Wave 3 (Assets 21–27)
	•	FAIL (library-wide) due to non-verbatim disclaimer.
	•	Content quality is closer to acceptable; still some steps need more specificity.

Wave 4 (Assets 28–33)
	•	PASS on disclaimer (these include verbatim disclaimer)
	•	Content quality: generally solid.

Wave 5 (Assets 34–47)
	•	FAIL (partial): Assets 34–46 use “Standard disclaimer applied.”
	•	Asset 47 includes the verbatim disclaimer (PASS).

Immediate Remediation Plan (Locked, Deterministic)

Patch A — Verbatim Disclaimer Injection (Mandatory)

Apply this exact text to every asset in Section 8:

This material is provided for educational and operational support purposes only and does not constitute legal, financial, or tax advice. Users are responsible for compliance with all applicable local, state, and federal laws and for consulting appropriate licensed professionals when necessary.

This patch alone will move most items from FAIL → Conditional PASS.

⸻

Patch B — “Elite Tier Expansion” Targets (Recommended)

To meet your stated “elite tier standards,” regenerate/expand (minimum) these assets after Patch A:
	•	Wave 1: 2, 6, 8, 9
	•	Wave 2: 13, 14, 18, 19
	•	Wave 5: 34, 37, 39, 45, 46

Reason: Section 4 needs to be more operationally complete (still generic, still non-legal).

If you want, I can regenerate those specific assets next in fully expanded form while maintaining all VERITAS constraints.

⸻

Next Step (No questions needed)

If you want the library to be truly “Elite Tier” and not just “compliant,” the correct next move is:
	1.	I apply Patch A to all 47 assets (verbatim disclaimer injection), and
	2.	I regenerate the 10 expansion targets listed above with fuller Section 4–6 content.

Say: “Patch A + regenerate expansion targets” and I’ll output the corrected versions in the same locked structure.
