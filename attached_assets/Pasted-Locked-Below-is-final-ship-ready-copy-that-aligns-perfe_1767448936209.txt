3️⃣ ONE-PAGE EXPLAINER

“How Licensing Works” (Office Buyers)

This page is designed for broker owners, compliance officers, and ops managers.

⸻

How DealControl Licensing Works

DealControl materials are professional documentation, not software subscriptions.

Our licensing model is designed to be:
	•	Simple
	•	Predictable
	•	Defensible

⸻

One-Time Purchases (Solo & Pro)

For individual professionals and small teams:
	•	You purchase access to a specific version
	•	You keep access to that version indefinitely
	•	There are no subscriptions or renewals

If an updated version is released in the future, you can decide whether to purchase it.

⸻

Office License (Annual)

For brokerages and organizations:
	•	Annual internal-use license
	•	Organization-wide access
	•	Includes updates during the license term
	•	Supports internal version control and consistency

This structure ensures:
	•	Staff are using the same materials
	•	Internal standards stay current
	•	Documentation is auditable

⸻

What Happens If You Don’t Renew?
	•	You keep access to previously downloaded versions
	•	You no longer receive updates or new versions
	•	Internal use restrictions still apply

⸻

Why This Model Is Used

This approach matches how professionals already purchase:
	•	Legal templates
	•	Policy manuals
	•	Internal SOP libraries

It avoids subscriptions while preserving clarity and control.

⸻

Summary
	•	No subscriptions for individuals
	•	Per-version access you keep
	•	Annual licensing only where updates matter
	•	Internal use only

If you manage people, files, or risk — this model is designed for you.
