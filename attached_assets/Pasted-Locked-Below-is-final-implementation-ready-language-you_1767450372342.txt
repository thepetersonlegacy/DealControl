1️⃣ INSERT INTO TERMS (FINAL — EXACT LANGUAGE)

Add the following sections verbatim to your Terms of Use / License Agreement.

⸻

Refund Policy (Digital Products)

Due to the nature of digital products, all sales are final.

Once materials are accessed or downloaded, refunds are not provided.

If a file is corrupted, incomplete, or inaccessible due to a technical issue, DealControl will provide a replacement file or alternate access. Refunds are not issued for successfully delivered digital materials.

⸻

License Activation

Access to and use of DealControl materials begins immediately upon download or access.

Once materials have been accessed or downloaded, the license is considered delivered, activated, and non-refundable.

⸻

Chargebacks and Payment Disputes

By completing a purchase, you agree not to initiate a chargeback or payment dispute for materials that have been accessed or downloaded.

Unauthorized chargebacks may result in termination of access and license rights.

⸻

Digital Delivery Confirmation

Delivery of digital materials is deemed complete when download access is provided, regardless of whether the purchaser chooses to download or open the files.

⸻

No Trial Use

DealControl materials are not provided on a trial basis. Purchasers are responsible for reviewing product descriptions and license scope prior to purchase.

⸻

2️⃣ STRIPE-READY POLICY BLOCKS

(Copy/paste into Stripe Checkout, Payment Links, or Customer Portal)

This is a digital product. Once files are accessed or downloaded, refunds are not available.

⸻

License Acknowledgment (Required Checkbox)

☐ I understand this is a digital product. All sales are final once files are accessed or downloaded. I agree to the license terms and refund policy.

3️⃣ REFUND REQUEST RESPONSE SCRIPT

(Polite. Firm. Final.)

Use this as-is. Do not personalize emotionally.

⸻

Subject: Your DealControl Purchase

Hi [Name],

Thank you for reaching out.

Your purchase included immediate access to downloadable digital materials. As noted on the product page and at checkout, all sales are final once materials are accessed or downloaded.

Our records indicate the files were successfully delivered and accessed.

If you are experiencing a technical issue with a file (corruption or access problems), we’re happy to provide a replacement. Please let us know if that’s the case.

Otherwise, we’re unable to issue a refund for delivered digital materials.

Thank you for your understanding,
DealControl Support

⸻

If They Push Again (Final Close)

Hi [Name],

We’ve reviewed your request again.

Because the materials were delivered and accessed, the purchase is non-refundable under our terms. We’re unable to make an exception.

This will be our final response on this matter.

Regards,
DealControl Support

4️⃣ DOWNLOAD FLOW THAT MINIMIZES ABUSE

(Simple. No DRM. No friction.)

⸻

Recommended Flow (Best Balance)

Step 1 — Checkout
	•	License acknowledgment checkbox (required)
	•	Refund policy visible
	•	Clear “digital delivery” notice

⸻

Step 2 — Thank You Page (Not Email Only)

Display immediately:

Your files are ready
	•	Download buttons shown clearly
	•	Reminder text:
These materials are licensed for internal use only. All sales are final once accessed.

⸻

Step 3 — Controlled Downloads
	•	Do not deliver everything as a single ZIP for Office / All-Access
	•	Use:
	•	Individual PDFs, or
	•	Secure portal with access logging (Gumroad / Lemon Squeezy / Stripe + member page)

⸻

Step 4 — Access Logging (Silent Protection)

Ensure your platform logs:
	•	Timestamp of access
	•	Files accessed
	•	IP or session

You don’t mention this publicly — it’s for disputes only.

⸻

Optional (High-Value Only)

Add footer watermark to PDFs:

Licensed to: [Purchaser Name / Organization]
Internal Use Only

This quietly discourages abuse.

⸻

5️⃣ WHAT THIS STACK PROTECTS YOU FROM

✔ “I downloaded everything and changed my mind”
✔ “I didn’t know it was non-refundable”
✔ “I never opened the files”
✔ Friendly fraud / buyer’s remorse
✔ Chargeback losses

And it does so without scaring legitimate buyers.

⸻

✅ FINAL STATUS
	•	Refund policy: LOCKED
	•	License activation: LOCKED
	•	Stripe checkout blocks: READY
	•	Refund response scripts: READY
	•	Abuse-resistant delivery flow: READY

You are now protected before the first sale.

⸻
